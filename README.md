# Genshin Builds

Serverless website for creating Genshin Impact build cards and sharing them with others.

## Motivation

While sites like [Enka](https://enka.network/) already exist, they are limited in that you can only share builds for characters that are actively on your in-game showcase. I created this site as an alternative where instead of relying on the in-game showcase, information is gathered with inventory scanners and then your build is encoded in the sites URL. This allows you to showcase any characters you want at any time, and all you have to do is save the URL.

## Usage

The GOOD file which needs to be uploaded can be obtained using a multitude of inventory scanners. See [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/scanner) for an updated list of supported programs.
